# vuid
> very unique identifiers

This module exports a tiny (144B) function that generates [UUIDv4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt) compliant identifiers in the browser. It takes advantages of and relies on the browsers built in `crypto` API; namely the `getRandomValues` function. This offers a [better level](https://v8project.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/theres-mathrandom-and-then-theres.html) of randomness than `Math.random` but means will not work in a node environment.

For all practical purposes the generated identifiers can be considered universally unique. The chance of two ever colliding is less than 1 in 5316911983139663491615228241121378304. Which is a pretty _cool_ guarantee.

### Import

You can install the package from npm and load it from node_modules or import it directly from unpkg in a script tag with type="module".

```js
import vuid from 'vuid'
import vuid from 'https://unpkg.com/vuid'
```

## Usage

Call the imported function.

```js
vuid() // 6dfc8a40-2d34-45b5-b3ab-aaf168e71aed
```
